# BLE FOTA Examples

This repository houses example applications built for the Arm® Mbed™ OS platform that demonstrate the usage and abilities of the Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE) firmware-over-the air (FOTA) service. The service specification and sources can be found [here](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-experimental-ble-services/tree/fota-service-github-ci/services/FOTA). As defined in the specification, the FOTA service facilitates the transfer of firmware updates over BLE.

The examples come with _batteries included!_ They're bundled with an automated build tool, "fota.sh", that eases the build process for the end-user. Please refer to the sections below for more information.

## Pre-requisites
Currently, the only supported target board for the examples is the [`NRF52840_DK`](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/Nordic-nRF52840-DK/). Development work to support [`DISCO_L475VG_IOT01A`](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Discovery-L475E-IOT01A/) will commence soon. The [BLE documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.12/apis/ble.html) describes the BLE APIs available on Mbed™ OS; going through this documentation isn't strictly essential to run the examples, but is helpful in understanding the sources.

## Build Tool
The `fota.sh` cli tool aids in setup and build of the examples in this repository. The tool takes in as arguments the example, target board, mount point of the target board, and toolchain. Please run `./scripts/fota.sh --help` for usage instructions.

> **Note**: If the mount point is not provided (it could be the case that an end-user is trying to build without the board connected), then the target binary is not flashed. This is especially useful for building the examples with a CI workflow.
>
> In the case of the MCUboot example, the _"factory firmware"_ is saved and would require manual transfer when the board is indeed connected. In either case, the demonstration step would be the only part that requires manual intervention from the user.
>
> **Important**: For now, the tool assumes the target board, toolchain, and example unless otherwise specified by the end-user. Currently, the only board and toolchain supported are `NRF52840_DK` and `GCC_ARM` respectively.

## Examples

Please refer to the example-specific READMEs for build and demonstration instructions.

2. [MCUboot Example](MCUboot)

## Known Issues
There are slight kludges with how the MCUboot and Mock examples are built with `fota.sh`. The former is a direct result of dependency conflicts between [mbed-tools](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-tools), [pyocd](https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD), and [mbed-os](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os). The latter is a result of issues with flashing the target binary to the connected board. The details of both are addressed below:

1. **Dependency Conflicts**: The difference in version requirements of the [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org) dependency imposed by both mbed-os and pyocd led to the creation of a temporary virtual environment; this is used in the "_creating and flashing the factory firmware_" stage of the MCUboot example build process. This is a known issue and would require changes to the `requirements.txt` file in the mbed-os to resolve.\
   \
   Another minor conflict that doesn't hinder the build process is one between mbed-tools and mbed-os on the version requirement of the [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/) dependency; mbed-tools requires that the minimum version of Click to be greater than 7.1 while mbed-os requires it to be greater than 7.0. Now, the dependencies for mbed-os are installed after those of mbed-tools, which overwrites the newer version and generates a conflict. This would (again) require changes to the requirements file in the mbed-os repository to bump up the minimum version number of Click to 7.1.

2. **Target Binary Flashing**: For the Mock example, compiling with mbed-tools results in the following error:
    ```
    ERROR: Build program file (firmware) not found <path to mock example>/target/cmake_build/<target board>/develop/<toolchain>/target.hex
    ``` 
   The tool is looking for a hex file under the cmake build output whose name comes from project directory (in this case, "target"). However, the generated one is named `BLE_GattServer_FOTAService.hex`. Again, this is a known issue and has been [filed](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-tools/issues/282) (282) in the mbed-tools repository by [noonfom](https://github.com/noonfom).
