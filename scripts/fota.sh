# Author's Note:
# The fota cli tool is used to setup and build the ble fota examples in this repository. The tool takes in as
# arguments the example, target board and toolchain. Note that if the flash option is not provided (it could be the case
# that an end-user is trying to build without the board connected), then the target binary is not flashed. In the case 
# of the MCUboot example, the "factory firmware" is saved and would require manual transfer when the board is indeed 
# connected. In either case, the demonstration step would be the only part that requires manual intervention.
#
# Important: The tool assumes the target board and toolchain unless otherwise specified by the end-user. However,
#            currently, the only boards and toolchain supported are NRF52840_DK and DISCO_L475VG_IOT01A and GCC_ARM 
#            respectively.

Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [options]

  A simple cli tool to automate the setup and build process for Bluetooth-LE
  Firmware Over the Air (FOTA) examples

Options:
  -e=, --example=TEXT             The example you are trying to setup and build.
                                  [default: mock]
  -t=, --toolchain=[GCC_ARM|ARM]  The toolchain you are using to build your app.
                                  [default: GCC_ARM]
  -b=, --board=TEXT               A build target for an Mbed-enabled device.
                                  [default: NRF52840_DK]
  -f, --flash                     Flash the connected target board
  -c, --clean                     Clean the example builds and environment
  -h, --help                      Print this message and exit

Note:
  For now, only the NRF52840_DK and DISCO_L475VG_IOT01A boards and GCC_ARM 
  toolchain are supported. Please connect only one target board when flashing.
